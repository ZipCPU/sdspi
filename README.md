# SD-Card controller

This repository contains two Verilog hardware RTL controllers for handling
SD cards from an FPGA.  The [first and older controller](rtl/sdspi.v) handles
SD cards via their (optional) SPI interface.  The [second and newer
controller](rtl/sdio.v) works using the SDIO interface.  This [second
controller](rtl/sdio.v) has also been demonstrated to handle eMMC cards as well.

## SPI-based controller

[The SDSPI controller](rtl/sdspi.v) exports an SD card controller interface
from internal to an FPGA to the rest of the FPGA core, while taking care of the
lower level details internal to the interface.  Unlike the [SDIO
controller](rtl/sdio.v) in this respository, this controller focuses on the SPI
interface of the SD Card.  While this is a slower interface, the SPI interface
is necessary to access the card when using a [XuLA2
board](http://www.xess.com/shop/product/xula2-lx25/) (for which it was
originally written), or in general any time the full 9--bit, bi--directional
interface to the SD card has not been implemented.  Further, for those who are
die--hard Verilog authors, this core is written in Verilog as opposed to the
[XESS provided demonstration SD Card controller found on
GitHub](https://github.com/xesscorp/VHDL\_Lib/SDCard.vhd), which was written
in VHDL.  For those who are not such die--hard Verilog authors, this controller
provides a lower level interface to the card than these other controllers. 
Whereas the [XESS controller](https://github.com/xesscorp/VHDL\_Lib/SDCard.vhd)
will automatically start up the card and interact with it, this controller
requires external software to be used when interacting with the card.  This
makes this SDSPI controller both more versatile, in the face of potential
changes to the card interface, but also less turn-key.

While this core was written for the purpose of being used with the
[ZipCPU](https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu), as enhanced by the Wishbone DMA
controller used by the ZipCPU, nothing in this core prevents it from being
used with any other architecture that supports the 32-bit Wishbone interface
of this core.

This core has been written as a wishbone slave, not a master.  Using the core
together with a separate master, such as a CPU or a DMA controller, only makes
sense.  This design choice, however, also restricts the core from being able to
use the multiple block write or multiple block read commands, restricting it to 
single block read and write commands alone.

*Status*: The SDSPI IP is **silicon proven**.  It is no longer under active
  development.  It has been used successfully in several FPGA projects.  The
  components of this IP have formal proofs, which they are known to pass.  A
  Verilator C++ model also exists which can fairly faithfully represent an SD
  card's SPI interface.  A software library also exists which can act as a
  back end when using the [FATFS library](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html).

For more information, please consult the [SDSPI user guide](doc/sdspi.pdf).

## SDIO

This repository also contains a [second and newer SD card
controller](rtl/sdio.v), designed to exploit both the full SDIO protocol and
the 8b EMMC protocol--either with or without data strobes.  This controller
has been tested against both SDIO and eMMC chips, with the differences between
the two types of chips handled by software.

The interface to this controller is roughly the same as that of the [SDSPI
controller](rtl/sdspi.v), although there are enough significant differences
to warrant a [separate user guide](doc/sdio.pdf).

The controller is designed to support IO modes all the way up to the HS400
mode used by eMMC.  HS400 is an eMMC DDR mode based off of a 200MHz IO clock,
using a data strobe pin on return.  Also supported are an SDR mode using a
200MHz clock, DDR and SDR modes using a 100MHz clock, as well as both DDR and
SDR support for integer divisions of the 100MHz clock, starting with a 50MHz
clock and going all the way down to 100kHz.  This is all based upon a nominal
100MHz system clock, together with a 400MHz clock for SERDES support.  For
designs without 8:1 and 1:8 SERDES IO components, 100MHz and slower clocks are
still supported, depending upon whether or not DDR I/O components are available.
Both open-drain and push-pull IOs are supported, and the front end can switch
between the two as necessary based upon options within a PHY configuration
register.  No support is planned for any of the UHS-II protocols.

*Status*: The SDIO controller has now been **silicon proven**.  It is currently
  working successfully in [its first FPGA
  project](https://github.com/ZipCPU/eth10g), where it is being used to control
  both an SD card as well as an eMMC chip.  Many of the components of this IP
  have formal proofs, which they are known to pass.  Notably missing among the
  component proofs is a proof of the front end.  Both
  [Verilog](bench/verilog/mdl_sdio.v) and [C++](bench/cpp/sdiosim.cpp) models
  have been built which can be used to test this controller in simulation,
  although only the [Verilog SDIO model](bench/verilog/mdl_sdio.v) has been
  tested to date.

For more information, please consult the [SDIO user guide](doc/sdio.pdf).

### Roadmap and TODO items

Although the RTL is now fully drafted, this project is far from finished.
Several key steps remain before it will be a viable product:

- **C++ Model**: An early [Verilator C++ model](bench/cpp/sdiosim.cpp) has
  been drafted.  It needs to be finished and tested.  No data strobe support
  is planned for this model at present.

- **Multi-block**: While simulation tests have demonstrated CMD17,
  `READ_SINGLE_BLOCK`, and CMD24, `WRITE_BLOCK`, the multiple block commands
  have not yet been tested.  These include CMD18, `READ_MULTIPLE_BLOCK`, and
  CMD25, `WRITE_MULTIPLE_BLOCK`.  Key features, such as the ability to read
  or write multiple blocks, or the ability to issue a command while a read or
  write operation is ongoing, are already drafted--they just need to be tested.

  _Note: These commands are implemented and tested via simulation in the dev
  branch, as part of the new DMA upgrade.  Their merge is pending a hardware
  test._

- **SW**: [Control software](sw/) has been written, and has been
  used to demonstrate both [SDIO](sw/sdiodrv.c) and [EMMC](sw/emmcdrvr.c)
  performance.  This software is designed to work with the [FATFS
  library](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html).

- **OPT_DMA**: An optional DMA extension is planned to allow data blocks to be
  transferred to memory at the full speed of the internal bus without CPU
  intervention.

  The DMA will be the focus of how the SDIO controller handles wider bus
  widths for higher throughput.

  _Note: The DMA has been implemented, integrated, and tested (via simulation)
  in the dev branch.  Its merge is pending a hardware test._

- **AXI Support**: A version exists in the dev branch that supports an AXI-Lite
  interface.

- **eMMC Boot mode**: No plan exists to support eMMC boot mode (at present).
  This decision will likely be revisited in the future.

  Boot mode will require support for eMMC CRC tokens, which aren't (yet)
  supported.  These are 8'bit return values, indicating whether or not a
  page has been read or written and passes its CRC check.
